"@Go2DeepSpace Thanks for all the good questions! We love to hear them!  Check out http://t.co/Fu0QMnQQCG for more info. #SpaceChat",2,0
"@Go2DeepSpace Next we power them on, then it rolls out to be fueled and get the launch abort system stacked on top. #SpaceChat",1,2
"@Go2DeepSpace The crew and service module are stacked! Tune into http://t.co/ar8AfVOESP to hear more about it 11:30aET on Wed! #SpaceChat",2,1

"@Go2DeepSpace We start out 20K mph &amp; btwn the atmosphere and 11 parachutes, we slow down to 20mph. They deploy starting @ 25K ft #spacechat",1,0
"@Go2DeepSpace I work landing systems, so although the whole mission will be exciting, I'll be watching the parachutes! #SpaceChat",2,0
"@Go2DeepSpace @NASA_SLS could lift 20 ppl but you still need to support them. Someday we'll have colonies elsewhere but there's work to do.",2,3
"@Go2DeepSpace There are robotic missions-@NASA_Hubble is taking amazing pictures. But my favorite is Orion! We'll send humans to Deep Space",2,3
"@Go2DeepSpace There's all types of different exploration going on. People are living &amp; doing experiments on ISS right now. #SpaceChat",2,2
"@Go2DeepSpace We're looking into concepts for a Deep Space Habitat right now! Find out more at http://t.co/WwH5GQWf52 #SpaceChat",4,5

"@Go2DeepSpace That's aluminized kapton tape. We added it to the heat shield to keep it from getting too cold. Heat shield likes it hot!",1,3
"@Go2DeepSpace We don't need to for our 1st mission. Future missions on the #pathtomars will have a living module that we'll dock with.",1,1
"@Go2DeepSpace We thought about it, but we shave off 1500 lbs of hardware by landing on water. That's 1500 extra lbs of science! #SpaceChat",5,4
